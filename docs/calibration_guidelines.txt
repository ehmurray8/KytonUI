KYTON PYTHON UI 

CALIBRATION
  -Instruments
    -LS 340 (331)
        -Reads the temperature of the oven using the platinum RTD thermometer
    -Dicon Optical (GP 700)
        -Rotates the fibers to a specified channel
    -Delta Oven 
        -Temperature set manually
    -Micron Optics Laser (SM 125)
        -Scans all 4 of its channels continuously
        -Change rate of scanning from the UI
        -Use peak wavelength(WL) and power from laser

  -User Input
    -Instruments needed (CheckBoxes)
    -Optical Switch Channels (EditTexts)
    -Serial #'s in order on each fiber, whether they are hooked to Dicon or not 
        -20 digit alphanumeric characters
    -Number of laser scans to be average as a data point (1-25) (EditText)
    -Number of T reading from 340 to be averaged for a T data point (Single digit) 
    -Time interval between T readings for data point. (1-5 mins) (EditText)
        -Diff btween 1st/last T data point divided by elapsed time to establish drift rate
        -Need to prevent the code from timing out
        -Questionable data point preferred to program timing out, flag questionable points
    -Drift rate allowed to trigger the WL data (mK/min) (EditText)
        -Typically few mk/min for LS sensors 10s mK to 1/10s mK
    -Number of calibration cycles in each run (EditText)
        -Each cycle is a separate calibration taken in sequence
        -Cycles compared for repeatibility and short term stability
    -Target temps in C (5-20 targets between 40 and 300C) (EditTexts)
    -Temp to which oven has to cool after highest T data point is taken, 
            before next cycle starts
	-Cool command choice on UI
    -File name to save (EditText)

  -Execution (Laser scanning continuously at set rate, and at set interval)
    1. Set next setpoint for the oven
        -Always starts at 45C
        -Allow user to take a base temp point "manually" before starting automatic, 
                and save to all files
    2. Take temperatures (T) from the 340 and calculate drift rate until 
                specified criterion is met
        -T data vs time realtime plotting
        -Only necessary to save T data associated with the WL data
    3. Take the set number of readings from the laser
        -Average the readings in the code
    4. Take a 2nd T and average the before and after values to establish the 
            change (drift) rate
        -Don't start averaging process until T is within 1K of target
        -Oven will overshoot/undershoot so sign will change
        -Drift rate will be 0 at each extreme, code can't call for this data at extremes
    5. Average the 2 T values and associate it with the peak value between the 2 Ts
        -For FBGs on the same fiber, the 2nd T can be taken after they are 
                all reported and 
            the average T can be associated with each of them
        -If the switch must be activated, another "first" T should be taken, 
                then all the FBGs on that switch channel, then a second T, etc.
    6. Save timestamp, interval in hours since 1st data pt, WL, peak power, 
            and T data and wait for next interval
        -Need CSV text file for each serial number, with auto-saving feature
