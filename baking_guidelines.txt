KYTON PYTHON UI 

BAKING
  -Instruments
    -LS 340 (331)
	    -Reads the temperature of the oven using the platinum RTD thermometer
    -Dicon Optical (GP 700)
	    -Rotates the fibers to a specified channel
    -Delta Oven 
        -Temperature set manually
    -Micron Optics Laser (SM 125)
        -Scans all 4 of its channels continuously
        -Change rate of scanning from the UI
        -Use peak wavelength(WL) and power from laser

  -User Inputs (No dwell time or drift detection/triggering in bake)
    -Instruments needed (CheckBoxes) 
    -Serial #'s in order on each fiber, whether or not hooked through dicon (EditTexts)
        -20 alphanumeric characters 
    -The number of data points to average (1-25) (EditText)
    -Time interval for data taking (EditTexts)
	-Need initial(frequent, hrs) and secondary(infrequent,mins) intervals
        -Intervals auto switch after user is confident in data 
    -File name to save text (EditText)
  
  -Execution (Laser scanning continuously at set rate, and set interval)
    1. Take a temperature(T) from 340
    2. Take set number of readings from the laser 
        -Average the readings programatically
    3. Take a second T
    4. Average the 2 T values and associate it with the peak value between the 2 Ts
        -For FBGs on the same fiber, the 2nd T can be taken after they are all reported and 
            the average T can be associated with each of them
        -If the switch must be activated, another "first" T should be taken, then all the FBGs
            on that switch channel, then a second T, etc.
    5. Save timestamp, interval in hours since 1st data pt, WL, peak power, and T data and wait for next interval
        -Need CSV text file for each serial number, with auto-saving feature
